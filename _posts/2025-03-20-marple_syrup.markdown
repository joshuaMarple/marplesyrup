Running gels are a great way to improve your athletic performance, but come with some serious downsides:

* lots of packaging waste
* high cost
* packed with preservatives

Furthermore, some of the latest research out there suggests that the running gels on the market may be sub-optimal for performance.

By making your own running gels, you can control exactly what works for you, eliminate waste, and save yourself some money.

## Recipe

I won't make you scroll all the way to the bottom, the recipe for making a running gel is pretty straightforward:

### Ingredients

| **Ingredient** | **Amount** |
| Sugar | 180g |
| Sodium Citrate | 4g |
| Kool Aid | 1 packet |
| Water | 90g |

### Directions

1. Mix the dry ingredients together.
2. In a microwave safe container, mix together dry ingredients with water, and microwave for 1 minute.
3. Stir until all dry ingredients have dissolved, reheating in microwave as needed

### Q/A

#### Isn't this just salty Kool Aid?
Yes it absolutely is.

#### Isn't this just rich simple syrup?
No! It also has salt in it.

#### Why do you use Sodium Citrate? Can I just use table salt?

I use sodium citrate because it's much less "salty" tasting than sodium chloride. It has a faintly tart taste to it, and isn't so overwhelming.

If you want to use table salt (sodium chloride), you absolutely can. Substitute the 4g of sodium citrate for ~2g sodium chloride.

#### How long can I store this?
Store in fridge for up to a month. Some sources suggest that rich simple syrup [6 months](https://www.tastingtable.com/953481/how-long-you-can-expect-homemade-simple-syrup-to-last/) as an upper bound, even at room temp. However, the added Kool Aid increases risk of contamination, which is why I recommend a shorter shelf life.

In practice, I mix this the week before, as the powder form is easier to store.

#### Is the Kool Aid necessary?

Nope. Its fine without it, but personally I felt it was too strange to drink straight syrup.

#### Does any flavor of Kool Aid work?

Yep, of course! While I prefer black cherry if I can get it, others have told me that it tastes like "cough syrup". I have also used fruit punch and lemonade flavors as well. Whichever flavor you like best is totally fine.

## Background

### Origin
I started looking into making my own running gels shortly after my first half marathon. I had used Honey Stingers for awhile, and while they upset my stomach much less than Gu, I found them to get fairly boring and expensive after awhile.

I started doing some research online, and stumbled across a number of relevant youtube videos.

I found it pretty fascinating, and got sucked into a rabbit hole of reading exercise science papers/blogs/videos (see citations below).

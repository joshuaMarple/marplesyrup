Running gels are a great way to improve your athletic performance, but come with some serious downsides:

* lots of packaging waste
* high cost
* packed with preservatives

Furthermore, some of the latest research out there suggests that the running gels on the market may be sub-optimal for performance.

By making your own running gels, you can control exactly what works for you, eliminate waste, and save yourself some serious money.

## Cost savings

## Recipe

The recipe for making a running gel is pretty straightforward:

| **Ingredient** | **Amount** |
| Sugar | 180g |
| Sodium Citrate | 4g |
| Kool Aid | 1 packet |
| Water | 90g |

Directions:
1. Mix the dry ingredients together.
2. In a microwave safe container, mix together dry ingredients with water, and microwave for 1 minute.
3. Stir until all dry ingredients have dissolved, reheating in microwave as needed

Store in fridge for up to a month. Some sources suggest that rich simple syrup [6 months](https://www.tastingtable.com/953481/how-long-you-can-expect-homemade-simple-syrup-to-last/) as an upper bound, even at room temp. However, the added Kool Aid increases risk of contamination, which is why I recommend a shorter shelf life.

In practice, I mix this the week before, as the powder form is easier to store.
